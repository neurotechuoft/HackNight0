Hack Night 0: Intro to Machine Learning and BCIs
(Based on workshop by BCIMontreal: https://github.com/bcimontreal/bci_workshop)

See the document ```INSTRUCTIONS.md``` for instructions to follow for the workshop.

## Current Issues
* unable to bypass admin requirements to access port 5000 (the port Muse is outputting to) ... anyone know if there's an equivalent of 'Run as Administrator' for a Python script?
* Need to get osc_input to work with exercise 1, 2, etc

## Differences btn Hack Night 0 and BCIMontreal's BCIWorkshop
* use of python-osc for direct data acquisition from the Muse (rather than using the MuLES software due to issues with Windows 8/10): see http://developer.choosemuse.com/research-tools-example/grabbing-data-from-museio-a-few-simple-examples-of-muse-osc-servers#python
  * this should make it easier to make our bot in the future
* use of Python 3.5
