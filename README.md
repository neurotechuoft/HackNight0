Hack Night 0: Intro to Machine Learning and BCIs
(Based on workshop by BCIMontreal: https://github.com/bcimontreal/bci_workshop)

This repo's still under construction! See the Issues section to see what we have to complete.

## Differences btn Hack Night 0 and BCIMontreal's BCIWorkshop
* use of python-osc for direct data acquisition from the Muse (rather than using the MuLES software due to issues with Windows 8/10): see http://developer.choosemuse.com/research-tools-example/grabbing-data-from-museio-a-few-simple-examples-of-muse-osc-servers#python
  * this should make it easier to make our bot in the future
* use of Python 3.5
