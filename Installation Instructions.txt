1. Install Conda from here: http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html
2. Open up your shell (Windows: Search 'Powershell' in your search bar, right-click, and Click 'Run as Administrator')
3. You can install Conda packages by typing 'conda install PACKAGE'. Install the following packages:
	numpy
	matplotlib
	scikit-learn
	pyZMQ
4. Some packages are available as GENERAL PYTHON PACKAGES, and aren't available in Conda to install directly. To install these, we first need to create a RECIPE! :D
	a) We first need a RECIPE MAKER. Install this package to get the recipe maker: "conda-build"   (ie: conda install conda-build')
	b) To make a recipe, we type 'conda skeleton pypi PACKAGE'
	c) We then need to build our package. Type in 'conda build PACKAGE'
	c) Then we can install our package! To install PACKAGE, we type 'conda install --use-local  PACKAGE'
	
	Do this to install python-osc.

What do these packages do?
	- numpy is used to deal with vectors and matrices and process them.
	- matplotlib lets you plot stuff :D
	- scikit-learn is a MACHINE LEARNING library. It will be the brains behind today's hack.
	- pyZMQ is 
	- python-osc lets you communicate with the Muse EEG device. OSC is a data format that many devices, including the Muse EEG uses. This package will let us get data from the Muse to process.
